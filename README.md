Chat Application

This is a very basic chat application, a proof of concept if you will. It's based on a socket io backend running on node js. The frontend implementation is done in ReactJS with a Flux framework. 

The username and password for the application are

First User: username = user1 ; password = user1
Second User: username = user2; password = user2
